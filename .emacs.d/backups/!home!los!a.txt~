Hey Lee,
Thanks for looking it over.

-- Skill Pool is for distributing points into the skills. Skills
   represent your baseline competency in actions. Aspects are more
   story driven elements that may effect your abilities. I'd check out
   the explanation in the FATE SRD. 

-- Dividing the Skill Pools (or Attributes as you call them) is
   something I borrowed from Fred's FATE Dictionary of Mu conversion.
   I'm hoping it allows the converted characters to be good at similar
   things they were before. 

[IME, Aspects are pretty flexible tools and work very well at
skill customization, and are often used for that.  Your own doc says
"If a skill is particularly important to you, consider getting an
associated Aspect."  I think that a single number for each Attribute
plus any associated Aspects will work very well.  If you want someone
with a good Strength but a concentration in Athletics, then just buy
an athletic Aspect.  

I think that you can get the converted characters to be good at
similar things as they were before, without dividing the Skill Pools.
That would give you many fewer numbers on a character sheet but no
loss of the characters you can express.  But that's really just a
matter of taste -- I'd much rather have a character that's got
"Strength +5" and "Track Star" rather than "Athletics +7; Wrestling
+5; Might +4; Toughness +4".  It's really a grain size issue.  

-- The Fudge Dice are centered on zero so I think if you are adding
   some randomness they are a better fit than other dice. Strange FATE
   adds in Tier which allow you to replace a Fudge dice with a d6
   which seems a good version of Ranked versus lower Ranked
   characters. 

I'm not questioning the use of Fudge Dice; I'm questioning the number
of them being rolled.  I've played a significant amount of Spirit of
the Century.  We always found that the dice variation was a bit too
large compared to the rather tight scale that the skills used.  We
tried a few modifications, but weren't entirely happy with any of
them.  The best of the lot was simply using 3dF rather than 4dF.
Better yet would be to have "weak Fudge dice" that have 4 empty sides,
1 plus, and 1 minus.  

-- If I wasn't using Skills then I would definitely divide character points by 5. I had an alternative version where you started out with more Refresh and reduced it to buy skill points at 5 per point of Refresh you sacrificed. I'll likely present both to the players since they are numerically identical and see which they prefer.

Thanks again. Its very nice to have someone look things over and give feedback. I'd love to understand your thoughts a bit better. Were those explanations helpful?
